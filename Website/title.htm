<br>
<p> On game boot the title screen will be displayed with the pocket computer always resident below</p>
<p> Pressing a cursor key will bring up the Title options menu. </p>
<h1>
<img src="pics\titleoptionsmenu.jpg" align="center" />
</h1>
<br>
<p> The options from top down are
<a href="Difficulty" id="A2">Difficulty</a>
(Easy, Difficult and Impossible),
<a href="ScreenMode" id="A2">Screen mode</a>
 (Colour or Monochrome),
<a href="AudioState" id="A2">Audio state</a>
(On or Off), 
<a href="LoadSavedGame" id="A2">Load saved game</a>
 and back to title.</p>
<br>
<p> Returning to title then pressing Fire will begin a new game. </p>
<p id=chapter>New Game</p>
<p> On entering the complex for the first time Ethan will start in the Lift in the left most shaft.</p>
<img src="pics/game_start.jpg" align="center" />
<br>
<p> Notice the map in the scorepanel. This map will give a live update of Ethans position in the corridors and lift-shafts. However this map will not be shown whilst he is in a room. Also notice that the map only shows the lift shaft and corridor nearest and doesn't show the rooms adjacent to him.
As Ethan discovers more rooms and corridors in the complex so these will be shown in the map.</p>
<p> Notice too that Ethans current position is shown as a glowing cursor in the map.</p>
<p> From this position Ethan can only move down.</p>
<p id=chapter>Corridors</p>
<img src="pics/corridor.jpg" align="center" />
<p> Now Ethan can move freely with left and right keys to run around. He can also somersault by pressing fire whilst a movement key is being pressed.
Pressing Fire on its own will take Ethan to the Pocket Computer.</p>
<p> Ethan can also enter the room on the left or right by simply running towards the exit.</p>
<br>
<p id=chapter>Rooms</p>

<img src="pics/start_room.jpg" align="center" />
<br>
<p> Each room may contain platforms, furniture, Security Terminals and robots.</p>
<p> In place of the map, rooms display messages issued either from Elvin or when things happen in the room </p>
<p> Ethan may move around in the same way as in the corridors however he cannot now access his pocket computer.</p>
<p> To rise from one platform to the next he may either somersault onto higher platforms as in this screenshot or
may use the Room Lift by stepping onto it and pressing either Up or Down to activate it.</p>
<p> The Robots that exist in the rooms act as guards to obstruct you.</p>
<p id=chapter>Robots</p>
<p><img src="pics/robot1.png" />
Each Robot may use one of a number of different movement patterns. The exact pattern of behaviour should be tracked before attempting to oppose the robot such as somersaulting over him or following him to reach a piece of furniture or seek passage.</p>
<p> Robots possess no senses beyond automated movement patterns but whilst they won't detect Ethans approach they won't react to it either.</p>
<p> Robots also possess an extremely high voltage plasma gun which is fired at particular points in the pattern.</p>
<img src="pics/robot_plasmagun.png" />
<p> If Ethan happens to come into contact either with the robot or the plasma gun he will instantly lose his life. In game terms this takes 10 minutes off his life and will reposition him at the entrance again.</p>
<p> Robots may only be disabled from the Security Terminal.</p>
<p> He may use the security terminal by walking infront of it and pressing UP.</p>
<p id=chapter>Security Terminal</p>
<img src="pics/securityterminal.png" />
<p/>
<p> Two options exist in this menu. The first to reset lift platforms in the current room and the second to disable all robots for 30 seconds.
However to activate either of the options Ethan needs to possess Passes that can be collected from some furniture.</p>
<p id=chapter>Room Furniture</p>
<p> Elvin has hidden puzzle pieces, lift reset passes and Robot Snoozes in the furniture. You must search each one to locate them.
Move infront of them then press and hold the Up key to begin searching.</p>
<p/>
<img src="pics/searching.png" />
<p/>
<p> During each search a box will be displayed containing a progress bar showing how far Ethan has got through searching the piece of furniture. After the furniture has been searched the furniture item will dissapear
and the result (if any) will be displayed whilst the Up key is still being held down. 5 points will also be awarded to the score.</p>
<p> <img src="pics/found_puzzle.png"> A Puzzle Piece was found </p>
<p> The puzzle piece will be added to your pocket computers puzzle memory and 100 points will be awarded in score.</p>
<p> <img src="pics/found_liftreset.png"> A Lift Reset Pass was found </p>
<p> Collecting a lift reset will award 50 points to the score. A Lift-Reset can be used in any room to reset the Lifts to their default positions. Use the security terminal to do this. The number of lift-resets ethan possesses are shown
in the scorepanel.</p>
<img src="pics/score_liftresets.png" />
<br>
<p> <img src="pics/found_snooze.png"> A Robot Snooze was found </p>
<p> Collecting a robot snooze will award 50 points to the score. The Robot snooze can be used in any room to disable the robots for 30 seconds. Use the security terminal to do this. The number of Snoozes ethan possesses are shown
in the scorepanel.</p>
<img src="pics/score_snoozes.png" />
<br>

<p> Most rooms contain some furniture. However there are two special rooms to watch out for. </p>

<p id=chapter>Simon Computer Room</p>
<p> The simon computer room houses a mainframe computer. It holds a large waist level console together with a electroluminescent display.</p>
<img src="pics/room_simon.png" />
<p/>
<p> It is used by Elvin to issue additional Lift-Reset and Snooze Passes. However to entertain Elvin's mind he devised a game to outwit the stranger.
In order to gain passes the player must play back a series of notes in ascending order.</p>
<p> The display holds a chequerboard with each cell representing a single note. On logging onto the console the game begins with a series of notes being played and their corresponding cells being momentarily illuminated with a cross.
After the sequence has been played (in nor particular order) a square cursor will appear and the Player must select each note but this time in ascending order.
If successful the computer will issue a pass (could be either) then animate the chequerboard to inidcate success.
If a wrong note is chosen then the player will be immediately logged out. </p>

The player is allowed to log on as many times as they wish. However on each successful game the computer will increase the number of notes played.</p>
<br>
<p>Note that the simon computer room is shown on the map as two light blue dots within the room.</p>
<p id=chapter>Control Room Doorway</p>
<p> Elvin resides in a central control room only accessable through a single doorway that can be found in one of the rooms somewhere in the complex.</p>
<p> The room looks like this one </p>
<img src="pics/room_control.png" />
<p/>
<p> Once the passcode is found then Ethan can enter this Control room (by pressing Up infront of it) and foil Elvin's evil plans.</p>
<p id=chapter>Puzzle collection</p>
<p> Puzzle Pieces are fragments of a punchcard. In total there are 7 punchcards and each one has been fragmented into 4 parts known as puzzle pieces.</p>
<p> Each puzzle piece may need to be flipped or mirrored then merged with another to form a more complete punchcard. The final punchcard may then require
further flipping, mirroring and colour filtering before it is recognised by the pocket computer, read and turned into a passcode letter.</p>
<p> Once a number of puzzle pieces have been collected the player should move Ethan to a corridor and access his pocket computer by pressing Fire.</p>
<img src="pics/scorepanel.gif" />
<p/>
<p> The Puzzle Editor replaces the map.</p>
<p> It contains the puzzle pieces found, on the left. This list is known as the Puzzle Memory.</p>
<p> The single slot on the right is known as the work memory.</p>

<p>When the cursor is moved right (off the power button) the current puzzle piece is selected. Moving right again moves the cursor to the buttons on the right.</p>

<p>When fire is pressed the selected puzzle piece is moved to the work memory. The three top buttons on the right side of the pocket computer control the work memory.</p>
<img src="pics/puzzlecontrolbuttons.png" />
<p>The first button will flip (mirror vertically) the Puzzle piece.</p>
<p>The second button will mirror (mirror horizontally) the Puzzle piece.</p>
<p>The third button will move all work memory merged puzzle pieces back into the Puzzle Memory.</p>

<p> When it is believed a puzzle piece in the Puzzle Memory can be merged with the work memory puzzle piece without any overlap then the cursor should be moved to select the puzzle piece (from the Puzzle Memory) and press Fire.</p>
<p> This will attempt to merge the two puzzle pieces together. If they overlap with one another then the pocket computer will reject the attempt.</p>

<p> And so the process should continue until 4 puzzle pieces have been merged together to form a punchcard like these ones..</p>
<img src="pics/punchcard1.png" />
<img src="pics/punchcard2.png" />

<p> However the punchcards may still require correct orientation. The may also require correct colour filtering. The second row of the buttons to the right in the pocket computer control the colour of the final punchcard. </p>
<img src="pics/ColourFilterButtons.png" />
<p> These are Yellow, Green and White</p>

<p> Once the pocket computer recognises the punchcard it will clear it from the work memory and issue a letter of the final Passcode. 500 points will also be awarded to the players score.</p>
<p> Once all the letters have been found Ethan must get to the control room (as described above) and defeat Elvin.</p>
<br>
<p> Ethan may also utilise the power of the mainframe computer by using the integrated Modem to dial out to check if the possessed Puzzle pieces are enough to form a single punchcard.</p>

<p id=chapter>Modem Menu</p>
<p>The bottom left pocket computer button switches on the modem menu.</p>
<img src="pics/modembutton.png" />
<p> when the modem menu is displayed and if sound is enabled then the dialling tone should be heard. This indicates that the modem has a connection to the outside world.</p>
<img src="pics/modemmenu.png" />
<p> Two options can be chosen. The first option will dial out to discover if the possessed Puzzle pieces are enough to form at least one Punchcard. The second option will dial out to scan for the location of the Control and Simon rooms. These will then be shown on the map when Ethan switches off the pocket computer.</p>
<p> On selecting either option a short pause will be experienced whilst the modem physically dials out to establish a connection with the Mainframe back at HQ.</p>
<p> to Quit the menu select the HANG UP option.</p>

<p> The three buttons in the bottom right of the Pocket computer are described in the following sections.</p>
<p id=chapter>Audio</p>
<p>During the game audio (sound) may be switched on or off with this button.</p>
<img src="pics/audiobutton.png" />
<p>The audio state will also be shown in the scorepanel as a tick or a cross.</p>
<img src="pics/audiostate.png" />
<p id=chapter>Statistics</p>
<p>During the game statistics will be accrued for the final report that Ethan will create on his return to HQ (should he survive to tell the tale). These stattistics may be viewed using the Stats button on the bottom row of the right buttons on the Pocket computer.</p>
<img src="pics/statsbutton.png" />
<p> The puzzle editor will temporarily be replaced with the game stats.</p>
<img src="pics/gamestats.png" />
<p> Furniture corresponds to the number of furniture that have been completely searched for items. Rooms are the number of rooms visited. Puzzles are the number of Puzzle pieces found. Punchcards are the number of Punchcards found and Simon Steps represent the level accrued using the simon Computer to gain more Passes.</p>
<p> Press any key to exit from Stats. Also note that viewing stats will not freeze time</p>

<p id=chapter>Pause</p>
<p>The game may be paused (freezing time) anytime during gameplay. However it will temporarily hide the Puzzle piece editor whilst it displays the message.</p>
<img src="pics/pausebutton.png" />
<p/>
<img src="pics/pausescreen.png" />
<p> The Pause Button will animate during pausing. Press any key to resume gameplay (and time).</p>
